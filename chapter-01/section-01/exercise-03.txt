UVA: 10911 - Forming Quiz Teams

You have been given the job of forming the quiz teams for the next ‘MCA CPCI Quiz Championship’.
There are 2 ∗ N students interested to participate and you have to form N teams, each team consisting
of two members. Since the members have to practice together, all the students want their members
house as near as possible. Let x 1 be the distance between the houses of group 1, x 2 be the distance
between the houses of group 2 and so on. You have to make sure the summation (x 1 +x 2 +x 3 +. . .+x n )
is minimized.

Input
There will be many cases in the input file. Each case starts with an integer N (N ≤ 8). The next 2 ∗ N
lines will given the information of the students. Each line starts with the students name, followed by
the x coordinate and then the y coordinate. Both x, y are integers in the range 0 to 1000. Students
name will consist of lowercase letters only and the length will be at most 20.
Input is terminated by a case where N is equal to 0.

Output
For each case, output the case number followed by the summation of the distances, rounded to 2 decimal
places. Follow the sample for exact format.
